# Tableau COVID-19 Dashboards
Example Tableau dashboards that display COVID-19-related analytics based on sample data in HealthShare Health Insight.
 
 
## Dashboard Descriptions
This demo includes a set of COVID-19 demonstration dashboards that show how data in Health Insight (not real data, but test data) can be visualized using a 3rd party tool. In these examples we used TableauÂ®, but other 3rd party visualization tools can also be used.
 
Three dashboard examples are available.
The COVID-19 Test Result Dashboard displays information related to COVID-19 test results. Users can filter results on the dashboard by time range and by state.
 
The COVID-19 Map and Usage Dashboard displays a COVID-19 infection map, as well as graphs related to ECMO and ventilator usage. Users can filter results on the dashboard by time range.
 
The COVID-19 Syndromic Surveillance Dashboard displays several graphs that show the prevalence of certain symptoms that are correlated with COVID-19. Users can select which symptoms data counts to display, and can also restrict the results by state, age range, and gender.
 
 
## Using the Demo 
In order to open the Tableau dashboard files, download and install the free [Tableau Reader app](https://www.tableau.com/products/reader). Then, open each dashboard file using Tableau Reader. At the time this demo was created, the current version of Tableau Reader was 2020.3.
 
These files are provided as examples only, and are not a part of the supported Health Insight product.
